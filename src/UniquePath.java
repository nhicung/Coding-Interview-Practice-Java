/*
DESCRIPTION:
	A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

	The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
	
	How many possible unique paths are there?
	
	Example 1:

	Input: m = 3, n = 2
	Output: 3
	Explanation:
	From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
	1. Right -> Right -> Down
	2. Right -> Down -> Right
	3. Down -> Right -> Right
	Example 2:
	
	Input: m = 7, n = 3
	Output: 28
	
SOLUTION:
	Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Unique Paths.
	Memory Usage: 33 MB, less than 5.10% of Java online submissions for Unique Paths.
