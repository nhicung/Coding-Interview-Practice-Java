SOLUTION:
	Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
	
	Example 1:
	
	Input: [2,3,-2,4]
	Output: 6
	Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
	Example 2:
	
	Input: [-2,0,-1]
	Output: 0
	Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
