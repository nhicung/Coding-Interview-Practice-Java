/*
 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
		Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
		
		Example 1:
		
		Input: 121
		Output: true
		Example 2:
		
		Input: -121
		Output: false
		Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
		Example 3:
		
		Input: 10
		Output: false
		Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
		
		
MY SOLUTION:
		Runtime: 6 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Palindrome Number.
		Memory Usage: 36.4 MB, less than 5.02% of Java online submissions for Palindrome Number.
